This project can be used as a Framework to mix iAd and Admob advertisement.

The basic principal is:
1. Create an iAd banner and an Admob banner in viewDidLoad
2. Only the iAd banner gets registered
3. When iAd fails Admob banner gets registered
4. If iAd would become active again, the Admob banner will disappear

Make sure to replace @"YOUR_ID" with your AdMob publisher ID!
